How to setup the development platform:

Info: Windows CE is a diverse platform. A lot of industrial use cases. Alot of the tools online are for building the OS, packages, kernal, drivers and such. There is a high likelyhood that none of the apps we built would match the same environment. However, normally upon completing an OS build usually you export an SDK which creates an envirnment for dev teams/app makers to build apps that will work for your platform.

We are going to install the correct versions of Visual Studio that support Windows CE, Gather the correct SDK for the Honeywell Dolphin 99EX so we can start developing solutions targeted at the correct environment.

The Machine I built this on: Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1 - Dell, Intel Core i3-3220, 8GB RAM, 64-bit.

1. Install Visual Studio 2008 Professional. It's the latest version that is compatible with windows CE 5.x
  link: Visual Studio 2008 Professional iso download link -http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/1/d/81d3f35e-fa03-485b-953b-ff952e402520/VS2008ProEdition90dayTrialENUX1435622.iso

  Unpack iso and run setup.exe

  Next install the Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK ( if you check the Sysinfo.txt file in this directory, you will see that Windows CE 5.2 is also called Windows Mobile Handheld 6 Classic )

  Windows Mobile 6 requirements for install: Visual Studio 2005 or greater and Windows Mobile Device Management.

2. Setup Developer account with Honeywell and download and install the Dolphin 99EX SDK -
  Register account with Honeywell to get developer options - https://hsmftp.honeywell.com/
  - Once logged in, on the left hand corner there is a file tree.
  Go to /Software/Computer Devices/ Handheld/ Dolphin 99 EX 99GX 99NI/Current/SDK

  - Download the Readme.html (a popup window will show explaining you need the software downloader, click the hyperlink "here" to download or try the link below)

  - In same directory on hsmftp.honeywell.com Download Honeywell SDK for Windows Embedded (7800 99EX) Setup r321.exe

  - Once SDK is downloaded. Got to Start Menu/Programs/Honeywell/SDK for windows../   Launch the batch file "Launch Visual Studio 2008"  - Should open up CMD briefly, then launch Visual Studio 2008.
