**These aren't the droids you're looking for.**

You probably don't want to use `node-letsencrypt` directly.

Instead, look here:

Webservers
----------

For any type of webserver (express, hapi, koa, connect, https, spdy, etc),
you're going to want to take a look at
[letsencrypt-express](https://github.com/Daplie/letsencrypt-express).

CLIs
----

For any type of CLI (like what you want to use with bash, fish, zsh, cmd.exe, PowerShell, etc),
you're going to want to take a look at
[letsencrypt-cli](https://github.com/Daplie/letsencrypt-cli).

No, I wanted node-letsencrypt
=============================

Well, take a look at the API in the main README
